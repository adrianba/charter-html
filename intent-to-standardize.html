<h1><strong>Intent to Standardize</strong>: &lt;feature name or short change description&gt;</h1>

<h2>Body:</h2>

<p><strong>Supporter emails</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; example@example.com, example2@example.com&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>

<p>Link to proposal (preferably in a github repository).&nbsp; You should have at least an unofficial proposal in hand and&#x2F;or have discussed the API within the HTML Incubator Community Group before sending an intent to standardize.&nbsp; If your proposal is not yet at this stage of maturity, feel free to solicit feedback informally on discourse instead. You may be asked to create a github repository if there isn&#x27;t one.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Give a high-level description of your proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Motivation and Use Cases</strong></p>

<p>Explain why the web needs this change.&nbsp; It may be useful to describe what web developers are forced to do without it.&nbsp; Include links to back up your claims, including data.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility Risk</strong></p>

<p>Please characterize how much we might regret standardizing this new feature were we might to change or remove it in the future. If you don&#8217;t have a github repository, include in this email links to relevant discussions, or documentation about support for the feature on the Web.</p>

<p><strong>Ongoing technical constraints</strong></p>

<p>Do you anticipate adding any ongoing technical constraints to the deployed user agents while implementing this feature?</p>

<p><strong>Will this feature be supported in all environments (desktop, mobile, tablets, TV, eBooks, automotive, etc.)?</strong></p>

<p>Yes or no.&nbsp; If no, explain why certain user agents will not be included in your implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Link to implementation experience and demos</strong></p>

<p>If your proposal has implementation experience or demos, please provide links to those. This includes common patterns in deployed libraries. Otherwise, indicate if there isn&#x27;t none.</p>

<p><strong>Data</strong></p>

<p>What data do you have available that indicates that this enhancement will affect many users of the Web.&nbsp; Quantify the fraction of websites that are currently using something similar to this feature.&nbsp; Or, if a new feature, characterize the reason that you expect this to be far reaching.</p>

<p><strong>Security and Privacy</strong></p>

<p>Outline the security and privacy implications of your proposal for end-users. Otherwise, indicate if there are none.</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>

<p>Outline the implications of your proposal relative to access by everyone regardless of disability. Otherwise, indicate if there are none.</p>

<p><strong>Internationalization</strong></p>

<p>Outline the implications of your proposal when used with different languages, scripts, and cultures. Otherwise, indicate if there are none.</p>
