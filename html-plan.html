<h1>Achieving maintenance and future progress of HTML</h1>
<p>The goal of this plan is to improve the tone and participation at W3C so that we achieve interoperability around HTML and continue to enhance the specification.</p>

<p>That can be achieved in 4 phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incubating new ideas</li>
<li>Efficient data-driven standards work</li>
<li>Interoperability</li>
<li>Maintenance (aka actual interoperability)</li></ol>
 <h2>Incubating new ideas</h2>

<p>There is one Community Group, called the <strong>HTML Incubator</strong> Community Group (HTML ICG). Its mission is to attract, foster, and refine ideas and proposals around HTML, by facilitating communication with developers at large or by using data-driven metrics to identify common patterns that warrant first class support in HTML. The HTML Working Group will encourage ideas to be incubated in the HTML ICG.  If the HTML ICG works with consensus, it will significantly reduce the effort to transition from CG to W3C Recommendation.

 <h3>From ideas to standards work</h3>
<p>Once a proposal becomes mature enough to justify formal standardization, it becomes the mission and responsibility of the Working Group to ensure proper acceptance, through consensus, wide reviews, <a href='#footnote1'>data-driven</a> analysis, and technical merit. A proposal may become ready for standardization efforts because of implementation experience or broad support.

<p>Supporters of the proposal should perform an &quot;<em><a href='intent-to-standardize.html'>Intent to Standardize</a></em>&quot; assessment, outlining use cases, as well as implementation considerations, security, privacy, accessibility, and internationalization impacts. It is the role of the Working Group to evaluate such assessment before starting a standardization effort.

 <h2>Efficient data-driven standards work</h2>
<p>The goal of  the <strong>HTML Working Group</strong> is to maintain and produce incremental revisions to the HTML specification and its extensions, and drive interoperability of implementations.
As in the CSS or WebApps Working Groups, a limited number of individuals from the general public can become (true) invited experts based on expertise.

<p>Each document worked in the Working Group should have two branches: a <strong>development</strong> one and a <strong>stable</strong> one. Daily work is expected to happen on the dev branch, including bug fixing. When applicable, changes must be backported to the stable branch. It is encouraged to have different individuals between the dev and the stable branches. The goal of the development branch is to encourage convergence of the implementations towards interoperability as well as introduce new function. The goal of the stable branch is to document expected interoperability.

 <h2>Interoperability</h2>
<p>The HTML Working Group is expected to demonstrate interoperability to move stable branches towards W3C Recommendation status. It is recommended to have a common set of exit criteria for the modules. This effort must be coordinated with testing through the Test the Web Forward efforts.

 <h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>Alhougth we demonstrate interoperability while moving to W3C Recommendation status, the Web Platform changes and we need to continually update the specifications to maintain actual interoperability in the field.
The HTML Working Group&#x27;s goal is to monitor interoperability of the implementations to <strong>achieve actual interoperability</strong>. As such, it is expected to maintain HTML and its extensions, and the Chairs need to ensure that bugs get property triaged, <strong>prioritized</strong>, and addressed.

 <h2>Organization</h2>
 <h3>Licensing</h3>
<p>A GPL-compatible with attribution License, such as the <a href='http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-text'>W3C Software and Text license</a>, will be used for the HTML specification and the HTML extensions in the Community Group and the Working Group.

 <h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>The HTML Incubator Community Group and the HTML Working Group are expected to have well-coordinated good leaders, well accepted and recognized by the community. The leaders should be selected to be magnets for the community - that HTML@W3C has become an effective place to get work done.  The leaders must ensure efficient progress and prevent discussion derailments. Due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness are the principles guiding the Community and Working Groups.

 <h3>Contributions and Communications</h3>
<p>The HTML Incubator Community Group and the HTML Working Group conduct their work primarily through github repositories, for contributions and communications. <a href='http://discourse.specifiction.org/'>Discourse</a> may be used for broad discussions with the community.  There will be one github repository per document.  Similar to open-source software development, peer production is encouraged: changes will be executed through Pull Requests, where each pull request gets preferably reviewed before being merged.<br>
See also <a href='https://specs.webplatform.org/docs/'>Web Platform Specs</a>.
</p>

<p>Regular activity summaries around the github repositories must be provided.

 <h3>Participation</h3>

<p>All Working Group participants are also encouraged to be participants in the HTML Incubator Community Group.  A major objective of this new plan is to encourage participation by those who can best drive innovation and interoperability for the web platform.

 <h2>Technical Directions</h2>

<p>While the technical direction for HTML will continue to evolve, here are some of the topics which we already know to be of interest for HTML.next, and should be considered by the HTML ICG based on data-driven metrics to identify common patterns:

<dl>
<dt>Markup for mobile UI widgets</dt>

<dd>There may be a set of elements that could usefully be added to HTML for (semantic) application components. One widget may be to provide a way for the user to indicate his geolocation to the application, without having to go through extra validation.</dd>

<dt>Stylable form controls</dt>

<dd>HTML5 Forms have the serious drawbacks of not being stylable, impeding their adoption. In order to define style, those forms would need to have structure, such as through Web Components</dd>

<dt>Responsive-but-performant design</dt>

<dd>The Responsive Images Community Group made progress in the area of images but more needs to be done.</dd>

<dt>Media APIs</dt>

<dd>New Media APIs are needed, and some coherence could usefully be brought amongst all the people extending HTMLMediaElement.</dd>

<dt>Canvas</dt>

<dd>The 2DContext is an area of continued interest and given its specific, focused work.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The HTML Working Group will continue the following efforts:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Editing</dt>

<dd>The existing joint HTML-WebApps TF is already well under way.</dd>

<dt>Media APIs</dt>

<dd>There is ongoing work around media streams and encrypted media extensions.</dd>

<dt>Accessibility</dt>

<dd>Much useful work is still needed in order for the Web platform to be accessible.</dd>

</dl>
